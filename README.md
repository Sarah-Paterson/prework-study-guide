# Prework Study Guide Webpage
  
## Description
This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
The modivation was to place notes from each section of the pre coursework in a single location for ease of access.
I built this project to practice using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It also provides a single location to store notes.
The Prework Study Guide webpage solves the problem of scattered notes in various locations as it provides a single space to keep notes as well as suggestions on where to start when studying.
I learned about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript at the beginner level.
